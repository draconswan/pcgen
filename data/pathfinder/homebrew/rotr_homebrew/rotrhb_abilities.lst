Immortal								CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:GM_Award.SpecialQuality	DESC:Secrets from ancient Thassilon and the realm of Leng have allowed Karzoug to sustain his life indefinitely.

Runelord Champion						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:GM_Award.SpecialQuality	DESC:Viorian bears the rune of greed upon her left shoulder, a physical manifestation of her role as Karzoug's champion. She has pledged herself to his service, body and soul, and as long as Karzoug lives (even while that life is confined to the far side of the runewell), she gains complete immunity to mind-affecting effects. In addition, she possesses SR 32 against spells from the school of transmutation. Unfortunately, being the champion of greed also brings with it an associated weakness against domineering runeforged weapons - she qualifies as a transmuter for that weapon's bane effects, and critical hits made against her with such weapons automatically confirm.
