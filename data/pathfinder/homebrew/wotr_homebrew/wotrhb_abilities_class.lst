Wild Card					KEY:Firebrand ~ Wild Card					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Gunslinger Class Features.FirebrandClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary											SOURCEPAGE:p.4		DESC:A firebrand uses her Charisma instead of Wisdom to determine the number of grit points she gains at the start of each day and to determine the DCs of her gunslinger deeds. A firebrand treats direct hits with her bombs as firearm attacks for the purpose of regaining grit (see the bombs ability on page 5). This ability works in all other ways like the gunslinger's grit class feature. This ability alters grit.		BONUS:VAR|GunslingerGritLimit|CHA-WIS	BONUS:VAR|GunslingerGritPoints|CHA-WIS
Dragon Fire					KEY:Firebrand ~ Dragon Fire					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Gunslinger Class Features.FirebrandClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary		SORTKEY:Class_Gunslinger_Deed_LVL01				SOURCEPAGE:p.4		DESC:A firebrand is a master of the volatile substance known as dragon's breath. As a swift action, the firebrand can spend 1 grit point to add her Charisma modifier to the DCs of all dragon's breath cartridges (Ultimate Equipment 42) she fires until the end of her turn. Her attacks with dragon's breath cartridges misfire only if a 1 is rolled on two or more of the damage dice.
Big Boom!					KEY:Firebrand ~ Big Boom!					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Gunslinger Class Features.FirebrandClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural		SORTKEY:Class_Gunslinger_Deed_LVL07				SOURCEPAGE:p.4		DESC:A firebrand can channel her explosive potential into a mighty blast. As a standard action, the firebrand shoots a 30-foot cone of fire from the barrel of her gun. The firebrand designates one creature in the squares affected by the cone to be the target and makes an attack roll with her firearm against that creature; on a hit, the target takes damage as if it were directly hit by both the firebrand's firearm and her bomb. Creatures in all other squares in the cone (as well as the target's square, if the gunslinger's attack missed) take splash damage as if they were in the area of the firebrand's bomb, with a Reflex saving throw for half damage(DC %1). Using this deed costs 2 grit points and expends one of the firebrand's daily uses of bombs (see the bombs ability on page 5), as well as the appropriate ammunition for the firearm attack; ammunition that does not require an attack roll cannot be used this way. When calculating the damage for a firebrand's Big Boom! ability, add any bonus damage to the attack once, rather than adding it to both the bomb damage and the firearm damage separately and gaining a double effect.|10+GunslingerLVL/2+CHA

Bombs						KEY:Firebrand ~ Bombs						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Gunslinger Class Features.FirebrandClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural											SOURCEPAGE:p.5		DESC:The firebrand gains the bombs ability as an alchemist of her gunslinger level – 4, using her Charisma modifier in place of her Intelligence modifier to determine her number of bombs per day and the DC to avoid splash damage. The firebrand adds her Charisma modifier to her bombs' damage instead of her Intelligence modifier, even if she has the throw anything class feature. In addition, the firebrand's bombs are always under the effect of the explosive bombs discovery. Firebrand levels do not stack with levels in other classes with the bombs class feature.

You can use %1 bombs each day. Bombs are unstable, and if not used in the round they are created, they degrade and become inert - their method of creation prevents large volumes of explosive material from being created and stored. In order to create a bomb, you must use a small vial containing an ounce of liquid catalyst - you can create this liquid catalyst from small amounts of chemicals from an alchemy lab, and these supplies can be readily refilled in the same manner as a spellcaster's component pouch. Most firebrands create a number of catalyst vials at the start of the day equal to the total number of bombs they can create in that day - once created, a catalyst vial remains usable for years. Drawing the components of, creating, and throwing a bomb requires a standard action that provokes an attack of opportunity. Thrown bombs have a range of 20 feet and use the Throw Splash Weapon special attack. Bombs are considered weapons and can be selected using feats such as Point-Blank Shot and Weapon Focus.
